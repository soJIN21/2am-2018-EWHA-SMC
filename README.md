# 2018 Graduation Project
#### SMC (Serial Magnetic Code)

Autonomous vehicle technology is developing, but it is almost impossible to overcome limitations of sensors with automobile technology alone. This project presents a road surface embedded serial magnetic code (SMC) module that enables autonomous vehicles and roads to cooperate with each other. SMC is a magnetic code with a magnet installed in the center of the lane. The project has designed the SMC system to give the road a unique code. In the autonomous vehicle, the SMC embedded in the road surface is read, decoded, and transmitted to the autonomous vehicle PC. It also provides the ability to follow the built-in SMC on the road so that the car can run on the lane.

#### Team 2am, Ewha Womans University, Korea

We are Kim Euna, Kim Gaon, Jin Sojung who are in the 4th grade of Ewha Womans University. We are a team that wants to develop software to help the world. We pay attention to the present age which is the transitional period of automobile technology and present new road assistance technology to overcome the limitation of autonomous vehicle.
